                        <p>People are getting connected easily with others using the network for sharing data. The data
                            is transmitted from the sender side to the client side either in a wired or wireless
                            connection and the mode of medium will be guided or unguided. For the wired way of data
                            transmission, the connections can be chosen from the coaxial cable, fiber optic cable, and
                            twisted pair cable. Wireless Communication emerged in the 19th century and is used in every
                            field of communication.</p>

                        <h4 class="card-title">Wireless Communication</h4>
                        <p>Data communication occurs in the unguided medium when the sender and receiver are not
                            physically connected but use the free space as a medium for transmission using the antennas.
                            The data transmission either uses Radio waves or microwaves to transmit wirelessly between
                            the devices.</p>

                        <h4 class="card-title">Generation of Wireless Communication</h4>
                        <p>Martin Cooper is the man behind the evolution of wireless communication. It initially
                            invented a device that wirelessly transmitted data and is considered the first generation of
                            mobile communication. The various generations of wireless communication are −</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1G</li>
                            <li>2G</li>
                            <li>3G</li>
                            <li>4G</li>
                            <li>5G</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="card-title">1G Wireless Communication</h4>
                        <p>1G was introduced in the USA. The first generation is the initial step to today’s technology
                            and was introduced in the year the 1980s. Using the 1G technology, we can only make voice
                            calls. The data is transmitted between the devices using analog signals. Out of the two
                            types of frequency modulation, analog Frequency modulation is used and modulates the data
                            signals in the form of sine waves.</p>



                        <h4 class="card-title">Features of 1G wireless communication</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Operating frequency of 1G is 800 MHz and 900 MHz.</li>
                            <li>The Maximum rate of speed can be up to 2.5Kbps.</li>
                            <li>The Capacity of data to transmit via 1G will have a bandwidth of 30 KHz.</li>
                        </ul>


                        <h4 class="card-title">Drawbacks of 1G Technology</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Only the voice can be transmitted in 1G and its quality is very low.</li>
                            <li>Mobile Phones cannot have a long life in battery usage and are very bigger which is very

                        <p>A Cellular Network is formed of some cells. The cell covers a geographical region and has a
                            base station analogous to 802.11 AP which helps mobile users attach to the network and there
                            is an air interface of physical and data link layer protocol between mobile and base
                            station. All these base stations are connected to the Mobile Switching Center which connects
                            cells to a wide-area net, manages call setup, and handles mobility. <br> There is a certain
                            radio spectrum that is allocated to the base station and to a particular region and that now
                            needs to be shared. There are two techniques for sharing mobile-to-base station radio
                            spectrum: </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Combined FDMA/TDMA:</b> It divides the spectrum into frequency channels and divides
                                each channel into time slots.</li>
                            <li><b>Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA):</b> It allows the reuse of the same spectrum
                                over all cells. Net capacity improvement. Two frequency bands are used one of which is
                                for the forwarding channel (cell-site to subscriber) and one for the reverse channel
                                (sub to cell-site).</li>
                        </ul>


                        <h4 class="card-title">Cell Fundamentals</h4>
                        <p>In practice, cells are of arbitrary shape(close to a circle) because it has the same power on
                            all sides and has same sensitivity on all sides, but putting up two-three circles together
                            may result in interleaving gaps or may intersect each other so order to solve this problem
                            we can use equilateral triangle, square or a regular hexagon in which hexagonal cell is
                            close to a circle used for a system design. Co-channel reuse ratio is given by: </p>

                        <pre>
                        DL/RL = Square root of (3N)
                        Where, 
                        DL = Distance between co-channel cells
                        RL = Cell Radius
                        N = Cluster Size 
                    </pre>

                        <p>The number of cells in cluster N determines the amount of co-channel interference and also
                            the number of frequency channels available per cell.</p>

                        <h4 class="card-title">Cell Splitting</h4>
                        <p>When the number of subscribers in a given area increases allocation of more channels covered
                            by that channel is necessary, which is done by cell splitting. A single small cell midway
                            between two co-channel cells is introduced.</p>

                            <li><b>Femtocells:</b> The smallest unit of the hierarchy, these cells need to cover only a
                                few meters where all devices are in the physical range of the uses.</li>
                            <li><b>Picocells:</b> The size of these networks is in the range of a few tens of meters,
                                e.g., WLANs.</li>
                            <li><b>Microcells:</b> Cover a range of hundreds of meters e.g. in urban areas to support
                                PCS which is another kind of mobile technology.</li>
                            <li><b>Macrocells:</b> Cover areas in the order of several kilometers, e.g., cover

                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="card-title">Fixed Channel Allocation</h4>
                        <p>For a particular channel, the frequency band which is associated is fixed. The total number
                            of channels is given by </p>

                        <pre>
                        Nc = W/B 
                        Where, 
                        W = Bandwidth of the available spectrum, 
                        B = Bandwidth needed by each channels per cell, 
                        Cc = Nc/N where N is the cluster size 
                    </pre>

                        <p>Adjacent radio frequency bands are assigned to different cells. In analog, each channel
                            corresponds to one user while in digital each RF channel carries several time slots or codes
                            (TDMA/CDMA). Simple to implement as traffic is uniform.</p>



                        <h4 class="card-title">Global System for Mobile (GSM) Communications</h4>
                        <p>GSM uses 124 frequency channels, each of which uses an 8-slot Time Division Multiplexing
                            (TDM) system. There is a frequency band that is also fixed. Transmitting and receiving do
                            not happen in the same time slot because the GSM radios cannot transmit and receive at the
                            same time and it takes time to switch from one to the other. A data frame is transmitted in
                            547 microseconds, but a transmitter is only allowed to send one data frame every 4.615
                            microseconds since it is sharing the channel with seven other stations. The gross rate of
                            each channel is 270, 833 bps divided among eight users, which gives 33.854 kbps gross. </p>


                        <h4 class="card-title">Control Channel (CC)</h4>
                        <p>Apart from user channels, there are some control channels which is used to manage the system.

                        <ol>
                            <li>The broadcast control channel (BCC): It is a continuous stream of output from the base
                                station’s identity and the channel status. All mobile stations monitor their signal
                                strength to see when they move into a new cell.
                            </li>
                            <li>The dedicated control channel (DCC): It is used for location updating, registration, and
                                call setup. In particular, each base station maintains a database of mobile stations.
                                Information needed to maintain this database is sent to the dedicated control channel.
                            </li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Is the paging channel, that the base station uses to announce incoming calls. Each
                                mobile station monitors it continuously to watch for calls it should answer.</li>
                            <li>Is the random access channel that allows the users to request a slot on the dedicated
                                control channel. If two requests collide, they are garbled and have to be retried later.
                            </li>
                            <li>Is the access grant channel which is the announced assigned slot.</li>

                        <p>In wireless communication systems, it is often desirable to allow the subscriber to send
                            information
                            simultaneously from the mobile station to the base station while receiving information from
                            the base
                            station to the mobile station.</p>
                        <p>A cellular system divides any given area into cells where a mobile unit in each cell
                            communicates
                            with a base station. The main aim in the cellular system design is to be able to increase
                            the capacity
                            of the channel, i.e., to handle as many calls as possible in a given bandwidth with a
                            sufficient level of
                            quality of service.</p>
                        <p>There are several different ways to allow access to the channel. These includes mainly the
                            following –
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Frequency division multiple-access (FDMA)</li>
                            <li>Time division multiple-access (TDMA)</li>
                            <li>Code division multiple-access (CDMA)</li>
                            <li>Space division multiple access (SDMA)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Depending on how the available bandwidth is allocated to the users, these techniques can be
                            classified as narrowband and wideband systems.</p>
                        <h4 class="card-title">Narrowband Systems</h4>
                        <p>Systems operating with channels substantially narrower than the coherence bandwidth are
                            called as
                            Narrow band systems. Narrow band TDMA allows users to use the same channel but allocates a
                            unique time slot to each user on the channel, thus separating a small number of users in
                            time on a
                            single channel.</p>


                        <h4 class="card-title">Wideband Systems</h4>
                        <p>In wideband systems, the transmission bandwidth of a single channel is much larger than the
                            coherence bandwidth of the channel. Thus, multipath fading doesn’t greatly affect the
                            received
                            signal within a wideband channel, and frequency selective fades occur only in a small
                            fraction of the
                            signal bandwidth.
                        </p>


                        <h4 class="card-title">Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)</h4>
                        <p>FDMA is the basic technology for advanced mobile phone services. The features of FDMA are as
                            follows.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>FDMA allots a different sub-band of frequency to each different user to access the
                                network.</li>
                            <li>If FDMA is not in use, the channel is left idle instead of allotting to the other users.
                            </li>
                            <li>FDMA is implemented in Narrowband systems and it is less complex than TDMA.</li>
                            <li>Tight filtering is done here to reduce adjacent channel interference.</li>
                            <li>The base station BS and mobile station MS, transmit and receive simultaneously and
                                continuously in FDMA.
                            </li>
                        </ul>


                        <h4 class="card-title">Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)</h4>
                        <p>In the cases where continuous transmission is not required, there TDMA is used instead of
                            FDMA.
                            The features of TDMA include the following.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>TDMA shares a single carrier frequency with several users where each users makes use of
                                non-overlapping time slots.</li>
                            <li>Data transmission in TDMA is not continuous, but occurs in bursts. Hence handsoff
                                process is
                                simpler.</li>
                            <li>TDMA uses different time slots for transmission and reception thus duplexers are not
                                required.</li>
                            <li>TDMA has an advantage that is possible to allocate different numbers of time slots per
                                frame
                                to different users.</li>
                            <li>Bandwidth can be supplied on demand to different users by concatenating or reassigning
                                time slot based on priority.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="card-title">Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)</h4>
                        <p>Code division multiple access technique is an example of multiple access where several
                            transmitters
                            use a single channel to send information simultaneously. Its features are as follows.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>In CDMA every user uses the full available spectrum instead of getting allotted by
                                separate
                                frequency.
                            </li>
                            <li> CDMA is much recommended for voice and data communications.</li>
                            <li>While multiple codes occupy the same channel in CDMA, the users having same code can
                                communicate with each other.</li>
                            <li>CDMA offers more air-space capacity than TDMA.
                            </li>
                            <li>The hands-off between base stations is very well handled by CDMA.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="card-title">Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA)</h4>
                        <p>Space division multiple access or spatial division multiple access is a technique which is
                            MIMO
                            (multiple-input multiple-output) architecture and used mostly in wireless and satellite
                            communication. It has the following features.
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>All users can communicate at the same time using the same channel.</li>
                            <li>SDMA is completely free from interference.
                            </li>
                            <li>A single satellite can communicate with more satellite’s receivers of the same
                                frequency.</li>
                            <li>The directional spot-beam antennas are used and hence the base station in SDMA, can
                                track
                                a moving user.</li>
                            <li>Controls the radiated energy for each user in space.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="card-title">Spread Spectrum Multiple Access (SSMA)</h4>
                        <p>Spread spectrum multiple access (SSMA) uses signals which have a transmission bandwidth whose
                            magnitude is greater than the minimum required RF bandwidth.</p>
                        <p>There are two main types of spread spectrum multiple access techniques −</p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Frequency hopped spread spectrum (FHSS)</li>
                            <li>Direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h4 class="card-title">Frequency Hopped Spread Spectrum (FHSS)</h4>
                        <p>This is a digital multiple access system in which the carrier frequencies of the individual
                            users are
                            varied in a pseudo random fashion within a wideband channel. The digital data is broken into
                            uniform sized bursts which is then transmitted on different carrier frequencies.</p>

                        <h4 class="card-title">Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)</h4>
                        <p>This is the most commonly used technology for CDMA. In DS-SS, the message signal is
                            multiplied by a
                            Pseudo Random Noise Code. Each user is given his own code word which is orthogonal to the
                            codes
                            of other users and in order to detect the user, the receiver must know the code word used by
                            the
                            transmitter.

                        <p>The combinational sequences called as <b>hybrid</b> are also used as another type of spread
                            spectrum. <b>Time hopping</b> is also another type which is rarely mentioned.</p>
                        <p>Since many users can share the same spread spectrum bandwidth without interfering with
                            one another, spread spectrum systems become <b>bandwidth efficient</b> in a multiple user
                            environment.</p>

                        <p>Radio Waves are types of electromagnetic Radiation. they are produced by the acceleration of
                            electromagnetic charges. Radio waves play an important role in communication, navigation,
                            weather
                            forecasting, medical imaging technology, etc. These waves have the longest wavelength in the
                            electromagnetic spectrum</p>

                        <h4 class="card-title">Propagation of Radio Waves</h4>
                        <p>Radio waves can propagate through air, water, various solid objects, vacuum and etc. The

                            radio waves to propagate through various materials depends on the wavelength and the

                        <p>There are three main modes of propagation of radio waves: ground wave, sky wave, and space
                            wave &mdash;</p>
                        <p><strong>Sky Wave Propagation</strong> &mdash; This mode of propagation occurs when the signal

                            transmitting antenna (Tx) is reflected by the ionosphere layer (sky) and received by the
                            receiving
                            antenna (Rx) is known as sky wave propagation. The ionosphere is the layer of the earth’s
                            upper
                            atmosphere that contains ionized gases and plasma. It protects the earth from harmful

                        <p><strong>Ground Wave Propagation</strong>&mdash; : This mode of propagation occurs when the
                            transmitting waves travel
                            along the earth’s surface and are received at the receiving antenna is known as the Ground
                            wave
                            propagation. The range of the Ground wave Propagation depends on the frequency of the
                            transmitted wave, the power of the transmitter, and the properties of the earth’s surface
                            and the

                        <p><strong>Tropospheric Scatter Propagation</strong>&mdash; Tropospheric scatter propagation is
                            a form of radio
                            communication that uses the scattering of radio waves off the Earth’s troposphere to reach
                            distant
                            locations. This propagation method works by bouncing the signal off small atmospheric
                            irregularities,
                            such as water droplets or dust particles, which scatter the signal in different directions.

                        <p><strong>There are several modes of radio wave propagation in wireless communication, each
                                with its own
                                advantages and disadvantages. Here are some of the most common modes &mdash;</strong>
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Ground wave propagation </strong>&mdash; This mode of propagation is used for
                            long-distance communication,
                            especially over land. The radio waves follow the curvature of the earth’s surface and are
                            able to
                            travel a considerable distance without being obstructed by buildings or other obstacles. The
                            advantage of ground wave propagation is its ability to cover long distances without the need
                            for
                            repeaters or other equipment. However, the disadvantage is that the signal strength
                            decreases
                            rapidly with distance, and the quality of the signal can be affected by changes in the
                            terrain or
                            atmospheric conditions.
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Sky wave propagation </strong>&mdash; This mode of propagation is used for
                            long-distance communication over the
                            ocean or other large bodies of water. The radio waves are reflected off the ionosphere and
                            can be
                            received by antennas on the ground hundreds or even thousands of miles away. The advantage
                            of
                            sky wave propagation is its ability to cover vast distances without the need for repeaters
                            or other
                            equipment. However, the disadvantage is that the signal strength can be affected by changes
                            in the
                            ionosphere, which can be caused by solar activity or other factors.</p>

                        <p><strong>Line-of-sight propagation </strong>&mdash; This mode of propagation is used for
                            short-range communication, typically
                            within a few miles. The radio waves travel in a straight line from the transmitter to the
                            receiver and
                            require an unobstructed line of sight between the two. The advantage of line-of-sight
                            propagation is
                            its ability to provide a strong, reliable signal over short distances. However, the
                            disadvantage is that
                            obstacles such as buildings, trees, or hills can block the signal, limiting its range.</p>

                        <p><strong>Tropospheric propagation </strong>&mdash; This mode of propagation is used for
                            medium-range communication,
                            typically between 30 and 300 miles. The radio waves are reflected or refracted by the
                            atmosphere,
                            allowing them to follow the curvature of the earth’s surface. The advantage of tropospheric
                            propagation is its ability to provide a reliable signal over medium distances without the
                            need for
                            repeaters or other equipment. However, the disadvantage is that the signal can be affected
                            by
                            atmospheric conditions such as rain, fog, or thunderstorms.</p>

                        <p><strong>Scatter propagation </strong>&mdash; This mode of propagation is used for
                            communication over short to medium
                            ranges in areas with obstacles such as mountains or buildings. The radio waves are scattered
                            off
                            these obstacles, allowing them to reach the receiver. The advantage of scatter propagation
                            is its
                            ability to provide a reliable signal in areas where other modes of propagation may be
                            obstructed.
                            However, the disadvantage is that the signal can be affected by changes in the terrain or
                            the position
                            of the obstacles.</p>

                        <h4 class="card-title"><b>Error Control Techniques</b></h4>
                        <p>Error control techniques are crucial in wireless communication to ensure reliable data
                            transmission despite the presence of noise, interference, and other impairments. These
                            techniques can be broadly classified into two categories: error detection and error
                            correction.</p>

                        <h4 class="card-title">Error Detection Techniques</h4>
                        <h5 class="card-title">Parity Check:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Simple Parity Check: Adds a single bit to the end of the data bits to make the number of
                                1s either even (even parity) or odd (odd parity). This method is simple but can only
                                detect an odd number of bit errors.</li>
                            <li>Two-Dimensional Parity Check: Extends the parity check by organizing the data into a
                                block and adding parity bits to both rows and columns. It can detect and sometimes
                                correct errors in the data block.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5 class="card-title">Checksums:</h5>
                        <p>A checksum is a value calculated from a data set and appended to it. The receiver
                            recalculates the checksum from the received data and compares it with the transmitted
                            checksum to detect errors. Commonly used in network protocols like TCP/IP.</p>

                        <h5 class="card-title">Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC):</h5>
                        <p>CRC involves treating the data as a large binary number and dividing it by a predefined
                            polynomial. The remainder of this division is appended to the data. The receiver performs
                            the same division and checks if the remainder matches the received CRC value. CRC is highly
                            effective in detecting burst errors.</p>

                        <h4 class="card-title">Error Correction Techniques</h4>
                        <h5 class="card-title">Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ):</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stop-and-Wait ARQ: The sender transmits a single frame and waits for an acknowledgment
                                (ACK) from the receiver. If an ACK is not received within a certain timeframe, the
                                sender retransmits the frame.</li>
                            <li>Go-Back-N ARQ: The sender can send several frames before needing an ACK but must go back
                                and retransmit any frames starting from an erroneous one if an error is detected.</li>
                            <li>Selective Repeat ARQ: Similar to Go-Back-N but only retransmits the erroneous frames
                                rather than all subsequent frames.</li>
                        </ul>


                        <h5 class="card-title">Forward Error Correction (FEC):</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Block Codes: Encode data in fixed-size blocks, adding redundant bits to allow error
                                detection and correction. Examples include Hamming codes and Reed-Solomon codes.</li>
                            <li>Convolutional Codes: Data is encoded using a sliding window method where the output bits
                                are generated by combining the current input bits with previous input bits. Decoding is
                                often performed using the Viterbi algorithm.</li>
                            <li>Turbo Codes: Use two or more convolutional codes in parallel and interleaving to achieve
                                high error correction performance. They are decoded iteratively.</li>
                            <li>Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) Codes: Use a sparse parity-check matrix to achieve near
                                Shannon limit performance. LDPC codes are widely used in modern wireless standards.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="card-title">Hybrid Techniques</h4>
                        <p>Hybrid ARQ (HARQ): Combines ARQ and FEC to provide both error detection and correction. When
                            an error is detected, the receiver may request retransmission of the erroneous frames (ARQ)
                            and use the redundancy in the received data to correct errors (FEC).</p>



                        <h4 class="card-title">Application in Wireless Standards</h4>
                        <h5 class="card-title">Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11):</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Uses CRC for error detection and ARQ for error correction. Modern versions like
                                802.11n/ac/ax also use FEC techniques such as LDPC.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5 class="card-title">Cellular Networks (e.g., LTE, 5G):</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Employ sophisticated error control techniques including CRC for error detection and
                                Turbo/LDPC codes for error correction. HARQ is also a fundamental component for ensuring
                                reliable data transmission.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Hard Handoff</li>
                            <li>Soft Handoff</li>

                        </ul>


                        <h4 class="card-title">Hard Handoff</h4>
                        <p>When there is an actual break in the connectivity while switching from one Base Station to
                            another Base Station. There is no burden on the Base Station and MSC because the switching
                            takes place so quickly that it can hardly be noticed by the users. The connection quality is
                            not that good. Hard Handoff adopted the ‘break before make’ policy. </p>
                        <p>It is generally implemented in Time Division Multiplexing and Frequency Division Multiplexing
                            when a user connects to the base station with a fluctuating radio frequency.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Hard Handoff is cheaper in cost as compared to soft Handoff because only one channel
                                needs to be active at a time.</li>
                            <li>It is more efficient than soft handoff, that’s why hard handoffs are widely implemented.
                            </li>
                            <li>Sometimes, a delay can be experienced while switching base stations.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="card-title">Soft Handoff</h4>
                        <p>Soft Handoff is a mechanism in which the device gets connected with two or more base stations
                            at the same time. At least one of the links is kept when radio signals are added or removed
                            to the Base Station. Soft Handoff adopted the ‘make before break’ policy. If a channel is in
                            power loss then another channel will always be on standby mode so this makes it best in
                            terms of quality as compared to Hard handoff. Soft handoffs are used in devices supporting
                            CDMA/WDMA networks</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>High Transmission speed as more than one repeater can transmit signals.</li>
                            <li>It has a very low delay in signals.</li>
                            <li>It can’t be implemented on devices supporting GSM or LTE networks.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4 class="card-title">Delayed Handoff</h4>
                        <p>Delayed handoff occurs when no base station is available for accepting the transfer. The call
                            continues until the signal strength reaches a threshold, and after that, the call is
                            dropped. Generally, it happens when the user is out of the network coverage area, or at some
                            dead spots where network reach is very low.</p>

                        <h4 class="card-title">Mobile-Assisted Handoff</h4>
                        <p>Mobile-Assisted handoff is generally used when a mobile phone helps a base station to
                            transfer the call to another base station with better-improvised connectivity and more
                            signal strength. This handoff is used in TDMA technique-based GSM devices.</p>

                                cellular service by the Federal Communications Commission.</li>
                            <li>It uses frequency division multiple access (FDMA) for multiple simultaneous

                        <p>Interim Standard 95 (IS-95) is a second generation (2G) mobile telecommunications standard
                            based on code division multiple access (CDMA) technology, which guarantees multiple access
                            when sending voice and data between mobile phones and cell sites. IS-95 operates in the 800
                            MHz and 1900 MHz frequency bands.</p>
                        <p>IS-95 is also known as TIA/EIA-95. It is marketed under the brand name CDMA One (cdmaOne).

                        <p>(Interim Standard-136) The second generation of the TDMA digital cellular system. TDMA
                            operates in North America in the 800 MHz band and 1.9 GHz PCS band. First introduced in
                            1994, IS-136 is also known as "Digital AMPS" and "D-AMPS."</p>
                        <p>D-AMPS transmits in the same 30 kHz frequency bands as analog AMPS, which results in a smooth
                            transition from an analog to a digital system. Voice data is compressed, allowing
                            partitioning into three timeslots. The voice capacity per channel is thus tripled.</p>

                        <h4 class="card-title">GPRS</h4>
                        <p>General Packet Radio System is also known as GPRS is a third-generation step toward internet
                            access. GPRS is also known as GSM-IP that is a Global-System Mobile Communications Internet
                            Protocol as it keeps the users of this system online, allows to make voice calls, and access
                            internet on-the-go. Even Time-Division Multiple Access (TDMA) users benefit from this system
                            as it provides packet radio access.</p>
                        <p>GPRS also permits the network operators to execute an Internet Protocol (IP) based core
                            architecture for integrated voice and data applications that will continue to be used and
                            expanded for 3G services.</p>

                        <h4 class="card-title">Who owns GPRS ?</h4>
                        <p>The GPRS specifications are written by the European Telecommunications Standard Institute
                            (ETSI), the European counterpart of the American National Standard Institute (ANSI).</p>

                        <h4 class="card-title">Key Features</h4>
                        <p>following three ket features describe wireless packet data:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The always online feature - Removes the dial-up process, making applications only one

                                rather, GPRS is added on top of the existing infrastructure.</li>
                            <li>An integral part of future 3G systems - GPRS is the packet data core network for 3G
                                systems EDGE and WCDMA.</li>

                        <p>EDGE stands for Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution. This technology, also termed as
                            Enhanced GPRS. This is a technology that uses the same equipment as GSM with only a few
                            minor modifications to provide faster data speeds and is often regarded as a stepping stone
                            towards 3G thus it is called 2.5G. EDGE gives the users the inimitable chance to increase
                            the throughput capacity and the data speed at least 3 to 4 times higher to what GPRS offers.
                            EDGE is a digital mobile phone technology but GPRS is a mobile data service. It is a 3G
                            Radio technology and GPRS or General Packet Radio Service is essentially packet oriented.
